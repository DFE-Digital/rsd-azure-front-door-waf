#### Configuring the storage backend

The Terraform state is stored remotely in Azure, this allows multiple team members to
make changes and means the state file is backed up. The state file contains
sensitive information so access to it should be restricted, and it should be stored
encrypted at rest.

##### Create a new storage backend

This step only needs to be done once per environment.
If it has already been created, obtain the storage backend attributes and skip to the next step.

The [Azure tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/terraform/store-state-in-azure-storage) outlines the steps to create a storage account and container for the state file. You will need:

- resource_group_name: The name of the resource group used for the Azure Storage account.
- storage_account_name: The name of the Azure Storage account.
- container_name: The name of the blob container.
- key: The name of the state store file to be created.

##### Create a backend configuration file

Create a new file named `backend.vars` with the following content:

```
subscription_id      = [the ID of the Azure subscription]
resource_group_name  = [the name of the Azure resource group]
storage_account_name = [the name of the Azure Storage account]
container_name       = [the name of the blob container]
key                  = "terraform.tstate"
```
